# SEO Content Generator Frontend

This is a React frontend for the Multi-Agent SEO Content Generator, featuring a modern workflow-style UI similar to n8n and Gumloop.

## Features

- Step-by-step workflow UI for content generation
- Research, outline, and writing steps with AI agents
- Interactive editing of generated content
- Modern, node-based interface
- Citation tracking and backlink management
- Markdown preview and export

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Node.js 14 or higher installed
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Running the Application

To start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

This will launch the application on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Backend Integration

The frontend is designed to work with the Streamlit backend. In a production environment, you would need to:

1. Update the API endpoints in the app
2. Configure proper CORS settings
3. Handle authentication and API keys

For now, the app uses mock data to demonstrate the UI functionality.

## UI Workflow

1. **Input Step**: Define content parameters (topic, audience, tone, etc.)
2. **Research Step**: View and edit AI-generated keywords and research notes
3. **Outline Step**: View and edit the content outline with citation markers
4. **Writing Step**: Generate the final blog post with proper citations
5. **Result Step**: Preview, download, or copy the completed content

## Technology Stack

- React 
- CSS (custom styling)
- ReactMarkdown for Markdown rendering
- Feather icons (via inline SVG)

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
